## Neighborhood Map with React | Udacity FEND Nanodegree | 2018

# About the Project

It's a final SPA project featuring a map of a chosen neighborhood. The goal of this project was to create a functional project with a react mindset, including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content. 

To achieve that I decided to create **_Neighborhood Map - Parks of New York_**
